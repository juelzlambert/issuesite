  <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>ClimateCall seeks to actively combat climate change by empowering and educating people and communities around the world. We empower and equip advocates for climate change to take effective action by educating the public and holding corporations accountable for their carbon emissions. We aim for a sustainable, green future where enterprises embrace environmental responsibility and our planet flourishes for subsequent generations through education, advocacy, and collaboration. </p>
    <p> We are all impacted by the worldwide crisis of climate change. Here, we provide you the knowledge you need to understand its effects and what you can do to change things. </p>

    <h2>Why does enviromental awareness matter?</h2>
        <p>We are currently living in a mass extinction. The environment that the world’s most endangered animals inhabited before us is being destroyed before our very eyes. The previous mass extinction was caused by an asteroid and couldn’t really be prevented, this time, however, humans are the asteroid. </p>
        <p> Money hungry and apathetic humans threaten the world we share with and are making it uninhabitable for a lot of animals. We have put hundreds of thousands of animal species at risk and a lot of people do not care or realize. </p>

        <p>  If advocates genuinely make an effort to become educated and then demand change, the politicians would follow the people’s demands. However, we cannot afford to wait until climate change is an emergency. </p>
        <p> We, as a society, have to act now because this is our home, our history, and our future. People can stand by and watch videos that show the ice caps melting, the weather patterns changing, the sea level rising, the coral reefs dying, and so many other examples of our environment collapsing around us, but nothing is going to change unless we hold ourselves and our representatives accountable. </p>

<p> <b> The other option is to do nothing, but by the time our children experiencing a
    snow day is a rare adventure, everything we have been taking for granted will be gone. </b> </p>
